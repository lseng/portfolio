                        <span>It is very popular at evening times and runs late into night, providing one of the very few safe and free public transportation methods in the UC Berkeley student community. On the Bear Transit, students are usually quiet throughout the ride. <b>A majority of them are on their phones, or listening to music.</b> Students often have to sit with their backpacks on their laps if they are sitting down, or place it on the sides of the chair, onto the ground. If the bus is less packed people will place their belongings in the seat next to them so they have an entire row to themselves. <b>Very rarely do students interact with the other commuters on the bus.</b>

                        <span>Around 10:00 am, where the rush hour slows down, not many students were taking the BART. Most of the people in the train cabins were post grad workers or seniors. There were a few people that might possibly fit the Generation Z profile and those potential individuals all had backpacks. The train was around 80% full, but they all had seats and put their bags on their laps.
                        <br>
                            <b>While on the BART they had their earbuds in the whole time and had their face glued to the phones.</b> All the single individuals exhibited this same behavior and the only changed was when they took their eyes off the screen when they arrived at the appropriate station.

                        Similar to those on the Bear Transit, <b>students are mostly engaged with their phones and headphones, and/or conversing with one or two friends.</b> There is not a great tendency to sit, but instead, students tend to gather and obtain personal space by standing slightly away from the other passengers.

                        Lastly we conducted research on Uber, an crowd-sourced/ridesharing service that provides either a personal or shared riding experience to customized destination points. Many students don’t typically take Uber to classes, but to destinations that are more out of reach, like San Francisco, shopping outlets, restaurants, movies, etc. <b>Because of the pricey nature of Uber for a single student, student Uber riders prefer to save money by riding in groups of friends, typically maxing out at capacity for Uber drivers. </b>
                        Ubers are most commonly used during mid-day and night time, where <b>many of the users complain about comfort when riding the Pool and Pool Express.</b>
