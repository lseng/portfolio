In order to establish a complete database for its users, Taux plans to partner with companies like Soundcloud and Spotify.</span>

                            Sadly, we were unsuccessful in finishing out this project by graduation, so we have put it down. In retrospect, I felt that this was a great opportunity for a group of high schoolers to tackle an incredibly challenging task: creating a company. On top of our busy school schedules, it stretched our mental capacity. We learned about common business practices, legal compliance, product design, and the user research process. <b>To some, this is an unsuccessful venture, but I consider it an important milestone that kickstarted my product design interest.</b>
