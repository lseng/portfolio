                            Though this is only a personal project prototype, I realized that there are many features that need to be flushed out. For instance, the report feature needs to be more informative, the log in screens and menu items need to be more intuitive to use. Furthermore, picking out the important information from the less-important ones are necessary to streamline the application.
