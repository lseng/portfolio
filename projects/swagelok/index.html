There are possible updates that could reach the thousands in numbers, so an efficient way to present that information is required. Furthermore, each larger category, such as “Valves”, have different types, thus creating sub categories. The hierarchy is like so:

                        I sent out a survey to random students at my high school and to see what they like and dislike about this design. Since it is only mid-fidelity, they had to picture what the final design would be like, and thus, could have skewed the results. However, since the functionality is the same between mid-fi and hi-fi, this round of user testing is most useful for feedback on how usable the website would be.
                            The results for functionality were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>~70% liked the hierarchical user flow</li>
